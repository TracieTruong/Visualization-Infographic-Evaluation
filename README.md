1. What is the graphic's purpose? Is it designed to present a quick overview, give prompts for deeper analysis, create talking points, etc.?  
=> This graphic is used to visualize the data on the demand for labour markets in Durham Region in 2025, in a very clear and accessible way
2. Are there chart types or visualization tropes that you recognize?  
=> The graphic uses Gauge charts, Bar charts, and photos along with numbers
3. Are there custom, novel, or unconventional chart types that you recognize? If so, how do you think they were created?  
=> No, all charts are very familiar and widely used 
4. Does “actual data” underlie the graphic? Does it reveal the data? Is the data transparent? Is it properly sourced?  
=> Yes, the data is cited under the graphic: [JFD Labour Market Insights Report Sept 2024 to Sept 2025](https://durhamworkforceauthority.ca/labour-market-insights-report/) 
5. Who is its audience? How much graphical or statistical literacy will they need to read it? Is this graphic designed for a lay or professional user? Policy makers?

=> The graphic is well designed and written in plain language so that it’s accessible to the public.
6. Is there anything that looks misleading? Is anything missing?  
=> No, the graphic represents the data perfectly well.
7. Is it trying to be persuasive? Is there an argument? If so, is it effective? Are the designer's biases clear? How could it be impactful?  
=> Yes, it is trying to be persuasive in an informative way when aiming to highlight labour market demands in Durham
8. Could you create a similar graphic using conventional visualization software? If so, what software application(s) would you use?  
=> I am well-versed with Canva, so I will use it to create a similar graphic
9. If you were to redesign elements of it, what might you change? 
=> The current palette is bold but heavy. I would reduce the saturated navy in charts to improve readability
